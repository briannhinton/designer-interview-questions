Our looping process: Research, Document, Pencil Sketch (ideation), Quantify Design (wireframes and basic prototypes), Approval, Document, Final Designs, Approval, Document, Implementation (code), Review Implementation, Approval, Release, Rinse and Repeat)
    
8. What if a design of yours wasn’t implemented correctly by a Front-end Developer, what would be your response?

    - Objective: Checking for basic understanding of user research
    
11. How do you know when a design is done?
    - Objective: Many would say when you can't remove anything else. Simplified to the bare minimum. My answer is that design is continously iterative, but a design is complete when the projects requirements have been met. But it is never truly done.
    
12. What would you do when a business sponsor rejects a design?
    - Objective: A business sponsor is the "stakeholder" for a project. They are the final judge on if requirements and project objectives are being met.
    
13. Can you describe a time when the requirements of a project changed in the middle of it's design, and how you handled that situation?
